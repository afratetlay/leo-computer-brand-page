## UX

### Project Goals

I created this page for Leo Computer, so they can showcase a variety of Epson printers they use/sell. 

### Design Choices

The design for this page is quite basic, just a banner at the top and a few blocks underneath.

## Features
 
### Existing Features

1. **Landing Page**
- I used `display: grid;` for the grid part of the page, I found using `display: gird` made it easier to display as well as make it responsive. 


2. **Screenshot**
